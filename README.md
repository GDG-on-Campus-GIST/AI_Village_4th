# AI Main Study for GDG GIST 4th

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the AI division of **GDG GIST 4th**. 

This repository provides fundamental study materials and resources for the main AI study sessions. All GDG GIST members are welcome to access and contribute. 

Feel free to fork this repository to your own account and work from there. And don't forget to leave a ⭐️star⭐️ at the top, your support means a lot!

## 01. Prerequisite

GDG GIST Cores & Mentors can guide you on your AI journey, but we are not a teacher that will provide all the answers. If you have little or no experience in development or AI, we recommend preparing the following before starting:

- Basic knowledge of <a href='https://clicktostart.gitbook.io/introduction-to-python'>Python programming</a>
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm, VS Code, Cursor)
- Understanding of <a href='https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners'>Basic Machine Learning concepts</a>
- Installed and configured environment for PyTorch projects (e.g., Python 3.x, PyTorch, CUDA for GPU support)
- Basic knowledge of PyTorch syntax (Please refer to BEGINNER_GUIDE.md)

## Main Study - PyTorch Toy Projects

Let's tackle some real-world-inspired PyTorch projects to get hands-on experience. 

After this projects, try creating your own unique & fancy projects and share with us!

### 1. Sick Plant Detection Project
Leverage **Transfer Learning** to build a model that detects diseased crops. Train your model on plant datasets and make an impact on agricultural technology!

### 2. Stage Video Cross-Editing Project
Use AI to cross-edit your favorite idol's stage performances! Develop a system that identifies similar moments across videos based on **similarity detection** and automatically generates cross-edit points.

### 3. Scream Sound Detection Project
Emergency response just got smarter! Create an AI security officer that reacts when it hears screams or other distress sounds. Build a sound detection model using PyTorch to implement this life-saving technology.
